# Revolutionizing_Eye_Disease_Detection
This project provides a qualitative and comparative
 investigation of both machine learning and deep learning for
 the classification of eye diseases, namely glaucoma, cataracts,
 diabetic retinopathy, and normal eye. Besides, we applied conven
tional machine learning methods based on Principal Component
 Analysis and Histogram of Oriented Gradients and compared
 them with the CNN-based VGG16 and ResNet50V2 models, and
 transfer learning. The accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and
 the ROC-AUC were used to evaluate the models to analyse the
 best approach to accurately detect eye diseases. The results of this
 work indicate that the DL models, especially transfer learning,
 are more effective than previous approaches to automating
 disease diagnosis and demonstrate the possible positive impact
 on medical diagnosis.
